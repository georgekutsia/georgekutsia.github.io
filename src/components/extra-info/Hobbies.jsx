                            I started playing Chess and competing when I was just 7 years old. I played all kinds of clasical Board Games <span>(Backgammon, Draughts, Domino, Reversi etc.)</span>
                            and than discovered a new world with modern ones after I moved to Spain at 13. I have a large collection of games <span>(Catan, Jungle Speed, King of Tokyo, Pandemic etc.)</span>, but my biggest
                            and oldest collection is <span> Magic The Gathering </span>

                          I was really good at everything related to math when I was young and loved the books my uncle <span> (Math and Science teacher) </span> gave me from time to tame. I participated in Ridle and Problem solving competitions in School and represented
                          my class competing with others. I was not the smartest, but loved thinking outside the box or reordering information and knowledge to figure out a solution. Still love it. Thats why its so fun Programming for me, even if it takes me ages to solve
                          something that already has been unswered online. Some things is better to figure out by yourself if possible and feel that rush of pleasure...

                              My mother always considered that I should know how to defend myself and my loved ones, so she instilled in me a love for martial arts and contact sports.
                              On the other hand, my father always says: instead of learning to fight in 20 years, learn to run in a month and that's it.

                              but in a martial art like Kung Fu or Muay Thai, competing is a very small part.

                              I'm not afraid to play sports that I haven't tried yet and I'm decent at the ones that I have tried. A long list, predominantly volleyball and basketball,
                              but staying in shape is priceless. As always, mens sana in corpore sano, helps to maintain a competitive and healthy mentality, collaborative depending on which sports.
